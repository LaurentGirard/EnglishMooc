                        <p>1. Believe it or not, the number one reason why a computer won't turn on is because it wasn't turned on!
                        Before starting a long time-consuming process, make sure you've turned on every power switch and power button involved in your computer system. </p>
<p>2. Check for disconnected computer power cable connections. A loose or unplugged power cable is one of the top reasons why a computer won't turn on.</p>
<p> 3. Plug your tablet, laptop, or desktop directly into the wall if it's not already. In other words, remove any power strips, battery backups, or other power distribution devices between your PC and the wall outlet. </p>
<p> 4. Perform a "lamp test" to verify power is being provided from the wall. Your computer isn't going to turn on if it's not getting power so you need to make sure that the power source is working properly.</p>
<p> 5. Replace the CMOS battery, especially if your computer is more than a few years old or has spent a lot of time turned off or with the main battery removed. Believe it or not, a bad CMOS battery is a relatively common cause of a computer that looks like it's not receiving power. </p>
<p> 6. Make sure the power switch is connected to the motherboard. This is not a very common point of failure, but your PC might not be turning on because the power button isn't properly connected to the motherboard.</p>

                       <p> 1. If you have integrated video and a video card, try the integrated video port. Resetting the bios, can make it default back to the onboard video. If you are trying to use HDMI outputs, try using DVI or VGA instead. Sometimes the HDMI ports won't work until the correct drivers are installed.</p>
                       <p> 2.  Install the latest motherboard chipset drivers.
Your motherboard contains a CPU, some RAM, expansion slots, and various devices. But it also contains some chips which make all those parts work together. The most important of these chips are called the chipset. You need to install the chipset drivers to make sure that everything on your motherboard is working reliably and running at full speed. </p>
					<p> 3. Uninstall your old display drivers and then install the latest display drivers.
Your video card must have a display driver installed in order to do anything but the most basic drawing to the screen. If you're having any problems with your video card, one of the first things you should do is download the latest display driver, uninstall the current display driver, and then install the new driver you downloaded. This can make lots of problems disappear. </p>
					<p> 4. Underclock your video card.
Some video cards are unstable if you run them at full speed. Slowing them down can make them work properly. When you slow down the video card, you are also cooling it down and reducing its power consumption. If your video card crashes, hangs, stutters, or gets display corruption a few minutes after you start a game, it may be overheating. </p>
					<p> 5. Do physical checks.
If you're having a problem with your video card, it's a good idea to open the machine up and take a look at it. Usually the problem is software or hardware related but occasionally it's just a mechanical problem. Sometimes removing and then reseating the video card in its expansion slot or disconnecting and reconnecting auxiliary power cables can get it to start working properly. That's especially likely to solve your problem if your computer has just been moved or you just built it and haven't gotten it to work yet. </p>

                         <p> First, check if your PC is really overheating :
When using a your computer in a normal way, you shouldn’t have to worry about overheating at all. However, if you’re encountering system instability issues like abrupt shut downs, blue screens, and freezes (especially while doing something demanding like playing PC games or encoding video) your computer may be overheating. If your PC is actually overheating we have some tips for you. </p>
<p> 1. Dust out your computer’s case. Dust accumulates in desktop PC cases and even laptops over time, clogging fans and blocking air flow. This dust can cause ventilation problems, trapping heat and preventing your PC from cooling itself properly. Be sure to clean your computer’s case occasionally to prevent dust build-up. </p>
<p> 2. Ensure proper ventilation. Put the computer in a location where it can properly ventilate itself. If it’s a desktop, don’t push the case up against a wall so that the computer’s vents become blocked or leave it near a radiator or heating vent. If it’s a laptop, be careful to not block its air vents, particularly when doing something demanding. </p>
<p> 3. Check if fans are running. If you’re not sure why your computer started overheating, open its case and check that all the fans are running. It’s possible that a CPU, graphics card, or case fan failed or became unplugged, reducing air flow.</p>
<p> 4. Tune up heat sinks. If your CPU is overheating, its heat sink may not be seated correctly or its thermal paste may be old. You may need to remove the heat sink and re-apply new thermal paste before reseating the heat sink properly. This tip applies more to tweakers, overclockers, and people who build their own PCs, especially if they may have made a mistake when originally applying the thermal paste.</p>

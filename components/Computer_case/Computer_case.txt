Computer case

A Computer chassis, tower, system unit, cabinet, base unit, or simply case is better know as a computer case.
He is the outer shell of a computer. So, he contains the components of a computer (usually excluding the display, keyboard and mouse). Its size varies depending on the components it contains.

Cases are usually constructed from steel or aluminium. Plastic is sometimes used, and other materials such as glass and wood.

The main reason for using a computer case is for the protection of components. Dust, animals, toys, liquids (beer...), food, etc. can all damage the internal parts of a computer if the hard shell of a computer case doesn't enclose them and keep them away from the outside environment

Hard disk drive

A hard disk drive (sometimes abbreviated as Hard drive, HD, or HDD) is a data storage device. He can be used to store any data, including pictures, music, videos, text documents, and any files created or downloaded. Also, hard drives store files for the software programs and operating system that run on the computer.

An internal hard drive is connected to the computer using a data cable (IDE or SATA) that connects to the motherboard and a power cable that connects to the power supply.

They are replaced, increasingly, by electronic memories of type SD card or "disks" SSD (which are much faster).

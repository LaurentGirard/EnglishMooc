The RAM (Random Access Memory) is used by the computer when it needs to perform parallel tasks on running programs. A motherboard usually has from 2 to 6 slots for the memory.
For that matter, when choosing the RAM, you must take into account a few parameters. 
The main one is the memory capacity : it may come in different sizes, from 2 to 128 Gigabytes (although you don't usually use more than 16 Gygabytes).
Another parameter is the frequency. The main information is that the frequency of all the RAM modules scale on the frequency of the slowest one.
Last but not least, the type of the RAM module : it is important to chose a RAM module that is compatible to your motherboard.
Some of the most famous RAM brands are Corsair, Crucial, G.Skill and Kingston.

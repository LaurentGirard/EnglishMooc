The network card is an optional component of your computer. Its purpose is to grant you an access to Internet and to serve as a hotspot.
Today, most computers embed a network card and allow you to plug an Ethernet cable, but you may want to use a specific network card if you need to connect by Wi-Fi.
If you need a Wi-Fi card, one of the things you have to check is the specification. For example, the 802.11b specification allows you a maximum speed of 11 MBits/s while the 802.11n allows you a speed up to 600 MBits/s.

                    <p>If you are a gamer you may not have ever heard about sound cards. There is a sound card integrated in each motherboard, but you can also have an external sound card.
                    
                    <p>A sound card (also known as an audio card) is an internal expansion card that provides input and output of audio signals to and from a computer under control of computer programs. The term sound card is also applied to external audio interfaces used for professional audio applications. Typical uses of sound cards include providing the audio component for multimedia applications such as music composition, editing video or audio, presentation, education and video projection.</p>
                    
                    <p>Externals sound cards are generaly used with professional audio applications by musicians, producers or recorders.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Computers need cooling to remove the heat their components generate during use. If you’re building your own PC — especially if you’re overclocking it — you’ll need to think about how you’ll cool it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Heat build-up can actually damage your computer’s hardware or cause it to become unstable. Modern PCs may shut down and refuse to operate if they reach a potentially unsafe level of heat.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There is four ways to reduce that heat:</p>
                    <ul style="font-size: 1.25em;">
                        <li>Heat Sinks : A heat sink is a passive cooling system that cools a component by dissipating heat. For example, your CPU probably has a heat sink on top of it — that’s the large, metal object. </li>
                        <li>Thermal Compound : CPUs and GPUs generally have a thermal compound between them and the heat sink. This may be called thermal grease, thermal gel, thermal paste, heat sink paste, or many other things. This material is smeared on top of the CPU, and then the heat sink is pressed down on top. The thermal compound fills any air gaps between the heat-producing component and the heat sink allowing more efficient transfer of heat. Be careful when applying this stuff, as you don’t want to use too much — you just want enough to fill in the air gaps between the CPU and heat sink, not so much that it will ooze out the sides and make a mess.</li>
                        <li>Fans : Fans force air to move, so the hot air is blown away from heat-generating components and expelled from the desktop or laptop PC‘s case. Fans typically blow hot air outward, but you could set up a system of fans to suck cool air inward on the front and blow out air out the back. Fans are an active cooling solution — they require power to run.</li>
                        <li>Water Cooling : The above methods are the typical types of cooling solutions you’ll find in most PCs, although some power-efficient PCs are designed to work without fans. Still, enthusiasts sometimes opt for more extreme cooling solutions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Water cooling, or liquid cooling, was originally for mainframes. Enthusiasts who want to overclock their hardware and push it as far as possible like water cooling because it’s more effective at cooling than fans, so a water-cooled PC can be overclocked further.</p>

                    <p>Water cooling involves a pump that pumps water through tubes that travel throughout your PC’s case. The cool water in the tubes absorb heat as it moves through your case and then leaves your case, where a radiator radiates the heat outward. This is only necessary if you need to deal with an extreme amount of heat — for example, if you’re overclocking more than typical cooling solutions can handle.</p>

                    <p>The network card is an optional component of your computer. Its purpose is to grant you an access to Internet and to serve as a hotspot.</p>

                    <p>Today, most computers embed a network card and allow you to plug an Ethernet cable, but you may want to use a specific network card if you need to connect by Wi-Fi.</p>

                    <p>If you need a Wi-Fi card, one of the things you have to check is the specification. For example, the 802.11b specification allows you a maximum speed of 11 MBits/s while the 802.11n allows you a speed up to 600 MBits/s.</p>
